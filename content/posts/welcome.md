# Welcome to My New Blog

I'm excited to launch this new version of my personal site! After working with a single HTML file for a while, I decided it was time to evolve to something more maintainable and flexible.

## What's New

This site is now built with:

- **Next.js** for the framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Markdown** for easy content creation
- **TypeScript** for better development experience

## Easy Content Management

Adding new posts is now as simple as creating a new markdown file in the `content/posts` directory. No more editing HTML directly!

## What's Coming

I'm planning to share more about:

- Technology discoveries
- Project updates
- Creative experiments
- Thoughts and reflections

Stay tuned for more content!
